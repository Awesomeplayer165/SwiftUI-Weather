# SwiftUI-Weather

This example app written in SwiftUI is my first app written in SwiftUI. It is optimized for macOS. Because it was built with SwiftUI, it is adaptive to different screen sizes and the window can stretched and shrunken down. It does not actually pull weather data from an API, but could in the future.

Note: There is no macOS `.app` available to download, rather the `.xcodeproj` and its assets. - [#1](https://github.com/Awesomeplayer165/SwiftUI-Weather/issues/1)
